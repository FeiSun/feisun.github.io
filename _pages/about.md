<!-- Now, I'm an associate professor at ICT, CAS. Prior to joining ICT, I was an algorithm expert at Alibaba. I recieved my PhD degree from the CAS Key Lab of Network Data Science and Technology in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Jun Xu and Prof. Jiafeng Guo, and Prof. Xueqi Cheng in July 2017. -->

<!-- Our team is focused on solving challenging problems at the intersection of AI x Biotech, building a fully-integrated AI platform for drug discovery.
If this resonates with you, we are actively hiring (full-time + internships)! -->

<!-- I have authored over 60 peer-reviewed publications in top-tier conferences such as ACL, WWW, and NeurIPS, as well as prestigious journals like TOIS and CSUR. Several of my works are recognized as highly cited on Google Scholar, with **6 papers ranking in the top 20 most-cited papers in the past 5 years**. I have also contributed as SPC or PC members over top conferences such as ACL, NeurIPS, ICML, IJCAI, AAAI and the invited reviewer for prestigious journals such as TOIS, TKDE, CSUR. I received the Best Long Paper Mention in RecSys 2019, and was selected by Stanford University as one of the [World’s Top 2% Scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7) in 2023 and 2024.
